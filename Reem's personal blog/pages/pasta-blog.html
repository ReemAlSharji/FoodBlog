                <p>
                    Pasta, a culinary marvel with roots tracing back to ancient civilizations, has evolved into an
                    international icon cherished on tables worldwide. Crafted from simple ingredients like durum wheat
                    semolina, eggs, and water, pasta manifests itself in an array of shapes and sizes, each designed to
                    cradle and complement an extensive range of sauces, flavors, and ingredients.
                    <br>
                    Italy, often heralded as the pasta haven, boasts a rich tapestry of regional pasta specialties, from
                    the slender elegance of spaghetti to the comforting curves of penne and the delicate folds of
                    stuffed ravioli. Beyond its Mediterranean origins, pasta takes on diverse forms in Asian cuisines,
                    where noodles of various styles play a central role in dishes from steaming bowls of ramen to
                    stir-fried creations.
                    <br>
                    Cooked to perfection through the art of achieving al dente texture, pasta's versatility transcends
                    cultural boundaries. It serves as the foundation for quick and comforting weeknight dinners,
                    elaborate feasts, and everything in between. The culinary world has embraced pasta as a blank
                    canvas, a vehicle for creativity that welcomes an endless array of sauces, proteins, vegetables, and
                    herbs.

            <h1>How to make Pasta :</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the Pasta:
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
                    Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente.
                    Reserve about a cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Tomato Sauce:
                    In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat.
                    Add chopped onion and sauté until translucent.
                    Add minced garlic and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant.
                    Pour in the crushed tomatoes and season with oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and black
                    pepper.
                    If the sauce is too acidic, you can add sugar to balance the flavors.
                    Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Combine Pasta and Sauce:
                    Add the cooked pasta to the tomato sauce.
                    Toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.
                    If the sauce is too thick, you can add some reserved pasta water to achieve your desired
                    consistency.</li>
            </ol>
