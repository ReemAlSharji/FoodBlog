                    Pepperoni pizza is a classic and widely popular variation of pizza that has become a staple in
                    pizzerias and households around the world. Its simplicity, yet irresistible combination of flavors,
                    has made it a favorite among pizza lovers of all ages.
                    <br>
                    Pepperoni pizza is often served hot and sliced into triangular portions. It's a popular choice for
                    casual gatherings, family meals, and quick bites, offering a perfect balance of savory, cheesy, and
                    slightly spicy flavors.
                    <br>
                    Pepperoni pizza transcends cultural boundaries, finding a place on tables around the world. Whether
                    enjoyed as a solo indulgence, shared during gatherings with friends and family, or savored in the
                    solitude of a cozy evening, this classic creation embodies the universal language of good food and
                    shared delight.
                    <br>
                    The magic begins with the crispy crust, offering a perfect balance of chewiness and crunch.
                    Generously spread with tangy tomato sauce, it forms the backdrop for a blanket of melted mozzarella
                    that stretches and oozes with every bite. The spicy, slightly smoky essence of pepperoni slices
                    crowns this masterpiece, adding a savory punch that elevates the pizza to unparalleled heights.

            <h1>How to make Pizza :</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the Oven:
                    Preheat your oven to the temperature recommended on the pizza dough package or your recipe.</li>
                <li>Roll Out the Dough:
                    Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. If you like a thin crust,
                    roll it thinner; for a thicker crust, leave it a bit thicker.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Tomato Sauce:
                    In a bowl, mix the tomato sauce with minced garlic (if using), dried oregano, salt, and pepper.
                    Adjust the seasoning according to your taste.</li>
                <li>Assemble the Pizza:
                    Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone, baking sheet, or pizza pan.
                    Spread the prepared tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
                    Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.
                    Arrange the pepperoni slices on top of the cheese.</li>
                <li>Optional Olive Oil Brush:
                    For added flavor and a golden crust, you can brush the exposed edges of the crust with extra virgin
                    olive oil.</li>
                <li>Bake:
                    Bake the pizza in the preheated oven according to the instructions on the pizza dough package or
                    until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
                </li>
