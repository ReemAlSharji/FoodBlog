                        A Swiss burger is a delicious and savory variation of the classic hamburger that incorporates Swiss cheese as a key ingredient. This type of burger typically features a high-quality beef patty, seasoned to perfection and cooked to the desired level of doneness. What sets the Swiss burger apart is the addition of Swiss cheese, a mild and nutty cheese known for its distinctive flavor and excellent melting qualities.
                        <br>
                        The Swiss cheese is often melted over the beef patty during the cooking process, creating a gooey and flavorful layer that enhances the overall taste and texture of the burger. This melted cheese adds a creamy and slightly sweet element to the savory beef, contributing to a well-balanced and satisfying flavor profile.
                        <br>
                        In addition to the Swiss cheese, a Swiss burger may be complemented with various toppings and condiments to enhance its overall appeal. Common additions include fresh lettuce, juicy tomato slices, pickles, onions, and a spread of mayonnaise or mustard. The choice of bun can also play a crucial role, with options ranging from classic sesame seed buns to artisanal choices like pretzel buns or ciabatta rolls.
                        <br>
                        The Swiss burger is often enjoyed for its rich and indulgent taste, making it a popular choice among burger enthusiasts. Whether served in a casual dining setting, at a barbecue, or in a gourmet restaurant, the Swiss burger offers a delightful twist on the traditional hamburger experience.

                <h1>How to make swiss burger :</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a grill or a cast-iron skillet on the stove over medium heat. Form ground beef into 4 evenly-sized patties. Season each patty with a good amount of burger seasoning.</li>
                    <li>Cook a batch of saut√©ed mushrooms and onions and set aside. It takes just 10 minutes to make these mushrooms and onions, and they are delicious!
                    </li>
                    <li>Add patties to preheated grill or pan. Cook for 8 minutes on one side, then for 6-8 minutes on the opposite side, or until cooked through. Turn off the heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>Top with a slice of Swiss cheese and let it melt while on the grill or pan. Once melted, remove the burgers and place them each onto a brioche bun. Top with mushrooms and onions, and serve.
                    </li>
