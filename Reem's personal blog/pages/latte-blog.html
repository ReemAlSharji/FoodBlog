            <ul>
                <li>Espresso:

                    1-2 shots of espresso (about 1-2 ounces)
                    You can use a stovetop espresso maker, espresso machine, or any other preferred method for brewing
                    espresso.
                    Condensed Milk:</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk (adjust to taste)
                    Sweetened condensed milk adds sweetness and a creamy texture to the latte.</li>
                <li>Milk (Optional):

                    6-8 ounces of steamed milk (optional)
                    For those who enjoy a creamier and milder flavor, you can add steamed milk. Use your preferred type
                    of milkâ€”whole milk, almond milk, or oat milk.</li>

                    Prepare 1-2 shots of espresso using your preferred method.

                <li>Optional: Add Steamed Milk (For a Latte):
